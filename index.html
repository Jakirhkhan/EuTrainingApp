    <p>
        Nearly one month after the inauguration of the metro rail service in Dhaka, Mirpur’s Pallabi station has opened to commuters on Wednesday, reports news agency UNB.

From today, commuters can travel from Uttara North Station to Pallabi, Pallabi to Uttara, and Agargaon to Pallabi, said managing director (MD) of Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) MAN Siddique.

Besides, a new timing has been set for metro rail as it will run from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm instead of 8:00am-12:00 pm, considering the demand of the passengers.

The gates were opened at 8:00 am for purchasing tickets, he said.
